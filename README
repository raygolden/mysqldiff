MySQLdiff is a tool for comparing the structures of two databases.

You pass in the details for both servers/databases then MySQLdiff checks for
any differences between the two.

It was a quickly written script and could do with being rewritten in parts,
however it does the job quite well. It is a touch incomplete and I'll try
and finish it off soon.

Any bugs, please email mail@timdavi.es


*** GRAPHICAL INTERFACE: ***
I'm planning to make a GTK interface for mysqldiff and perhaps rewrite the application in C, that's why there's a gtkbuilder file (gui.ui).
